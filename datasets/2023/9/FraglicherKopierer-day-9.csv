|Still in, even if you mentioned october|,y
|The last couple of days the urge began to appear. Sometimes I feel tension. You need to be especially careful at night before going to bed. Mood swings are possible. Calm and concentration are required.

|Day 9 still in, my balls ache and every time I think of anything slightly sexual or even just talking to a girl, my boner pops hard. I have tried edging for the past few days but that made my balls ache so I'm not going to do that often now.|,y

|With patience and will, we take the lead,
Nine days of fasting, avoiding temptations
Rediscovering life, the world outside,
NNN's journey, a victorious stride.

The lessons we learn, the strength we find,
In the digital detox, the ties that bind.
Through the challenge, we reconnect,
To the world, to ourselves, is self-respect.

So as we reach the ninth's day embrace,
With clearer minds and a steadier pace,
NNN's journey, we've come to see,
A reminder that balance sets us free.

STILL IN!
Let's keep going fellow cumrades o7|,y
