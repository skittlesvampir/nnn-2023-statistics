|Sons of No Nut November! Of 'begone horny'! My brothers!

I see in your eyes the same desire that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the willpower of men fails, when we forsake our oaths and break all bonds of abstinence! But it is not this day!

An hour of horny, and failed internet challenges when the Age of NNN comes crashing down! But it is not this day!

This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of NNN!
