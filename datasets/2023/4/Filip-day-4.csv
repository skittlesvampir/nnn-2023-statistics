|Still going strong. I haven't so much as touched myself lately (NSFW wise anyway). I'm hoping to make it through the month. Week 2 is usually when I get so frustrated that I just can't stand it. But, as the ild addage goes, you need to take this one day at a time.|,unknown

|Welp, fourth day. Too many thought "This shit's easy" and edged, and fucking lost as a result. Moral of the story, never underestimate your enemy, and DON'T EDGE.

This past two days got hands fr

But urges are getting easier to control

Was hoping to keep myself distracted with some Baldurs Gate 3 as I'd just installed a bunch of mods, but then a patch dropped which ruined those plans

Might go and play Elden Ring tomorrow...

|Day 4, still in...barely.  
Had a mini-anxiety attack yesterday. Seriously doubt it's because of blue balls, but it meant I had to sit through it all & not just "release."  
It was like having a finger cut off & having to resist taking painkillers.|,unknown
Still in woo hoo,unknown
