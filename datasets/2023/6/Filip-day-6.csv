|Still in. So far, it has been strangely easy. I shouldn't lower my defenses though.

Playing videogames and listening to music have kept me pretty distracted. Currently replaying Assassin's Creed 3 and Final Fantasy Type-0, and I'm collecting any missing seeds and purple coins in Mario Wonder.

I also decided to add 10 push-ups and 15 abs to my 20-30min daily exercise. My exercise always consists of taking a walk or riding my bike..

I know 10 and 15 doesn't sound like much, but before starting the "challenge" I couldn't even do 3 push-ups.
I'm happy to report that as of day 5, I can actually do 12 push-ups and 20 abs. Crazy to see progress already, it's weirdly motivating. I'll see how much I can do by the end of November.|,unknown

Yesterday was painful. I looked for support in my no-nut buddies but found out they all lost. I almost gave up too. Don't know if I can go on without them. Still in though!,unknown

Not a dick in hand

Cruel it feels

Unbeaten we feel

Monsters we will kill
