|Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton, and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.|,unknown

|Day 3 was a tough day for me, emotionally speaking. Nothing went my way. I had to just bow my head down and listen to the higher ups scolding me. It is what it is. Urges wise, honestly speaking, there weren't many urges today, but I did get hit with one 7/10 urge. 
But I'm Still IN. Not giving up at all...|,unknown

|In November's grace, the challenge is STILL IN play,
Breaking habits, for our own sake today.
A journey of will, a path to heal,
For mental health's sake, we make a deal.

No screens of temptation, we strive to resist,
With strength in our hearts, we persist.
A month of focus, a mindful quest,
For self-improvement, we do our best.

As days go by, and nights grow long,
We find the will to stay strong.
In this endeavor, we find our way,
To better mental health, come what may.|,unknown
