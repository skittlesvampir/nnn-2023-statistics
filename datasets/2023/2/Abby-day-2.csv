|Day 2 is almost gone, although we might get some urges, it is just in our minds, as well as power to control your hands, so use it mindfully, before you grab something unwillingly (:

|So I am not sure if the roll call is still open but I came here to say I am still in. Day 2, I am feeling good so far but my guard is this still up due to the fact I have learned from my mistake. This is my second time doing Not Nut November, last year was my first time. The reason why I failed last year's Not Nut November is because from day 1-3 I have gotten cocky and when day 4 came around I let my guard down and the urge came with a vengeance and I failed. I felt terrible and I made a promise that year that next November I will be better. This time I have learned from my mistake and I am going in strong. I repeat, I am still in.|,unknown
