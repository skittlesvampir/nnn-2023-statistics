|Still IN, the nuts aren't swellin yet

But that's about to change, and when

my girlfriend comes around in two weeks

and we go to sleep under the sheets

&#x200B;

and she goes to reach for my hand

and it slips down into my pants

then I might be nearing the end

my first loss in four attempts

&#x200B;

An honourable discharge might be awaiting me

a redemption from the quest of no nuttin

I went through the trouble of not watchin porno

But I won the treble, and I'M GOING FOR THE FOURFOLD|,y

|Still In. My question is, can I still get a diamond if I forgot to roll call for day 1? How does the 7 out of 30 work? Does that mean I only need to comment on 7 of the 30 roll calls to getting the diamond badge?|,y
