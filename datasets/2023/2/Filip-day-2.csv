|Day Two I'm still in. The temptations came faster than I expected, but I managed to resist the urges and keep going. My mind is been a mess, not because of the NNN, it's because I am studying and reviewing Mathematics and Physics topics because this Saturday I will have my university entrance exam, this is my second attempt trying to get get accepted, I've never been good at Math but still I hope I can make it. (Sorry if this has some typos ir weird grammar mistakes, I'm not from the US ando English isn't my first language)|,unknown
