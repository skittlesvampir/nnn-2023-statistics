|I come to the front lines, standing erect. Hardened, and ready. Twitching with anticipation as I thrust forward unto the future as it lies bare. Such ejaculations may seem crazy, some may even say nuts, but I fear not, for it will not be a stroke of luck, but my rock hard determination, that will result in the fruits of my heated labor.|,unknown

|Day 2 this is gonna be a long month. But do not worry, we are all in this together. I‚Äôm still in and I‚Äôm ready for the rest of the month and so should you.
