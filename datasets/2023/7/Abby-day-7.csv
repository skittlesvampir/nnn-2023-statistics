|I'm OUT, but still it's a remarkable achievement for me cuz I just broke my streak record of a week (I started from 30th October to gain some momentum). One piece of advice guys, if you've started edging to cope with urges, please stop doing so. One really sensual video and your self-control will go through the roof|,unknown

I had another hard day yesterday, but I still have not edged. I definitely felt the testosterone yesterday and I had urges upon urges all day despite taking a cold shower and swimming a mile. We are nearing where it started getting easier for me last year so I am hopeful.|,unknown
