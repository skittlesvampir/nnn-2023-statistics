|Day 10 reporting still IN.  


Yesterday I was super busy as a friend got graduated so I basically spent little to no time at home and that made the day super easy to get through: that's a boost given the fact that day 7&8 I felt pretty hopeless. 

Now we're almost a third done, you all have done great so far but remember that this is nowhere near what you are capable of doing if you put your mind into it. Let's keep it going!|,unknown

Last Night I busted while dreaming. I thought it would take a lot longer for my body to take over than 10 days. It sure feels like I have lost but there was nothing I did to start it and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I just woke up in terror and shock lmao. Am I out?,unknown

|I always forget to clock in but yeah, im still in. 

Here's the update: I've reached a point of enlightenment where all thoughts of jerking off went out the window and the only thing left is a HUGE urge to become strong and workout.

If anybody knows some good exercises you can do at home I would appreciate it greatly, thank you for your time o7.|,unknown

|Congrats, weâ€™ve made it to day ten,

Weâ€™re a third of the way until we win again!

The hardest part is almost done,

We approach the day that we have won.

This trail of days weâ€™ll pioneer,

Itâ€™s not too long until we win the year.

Harness your power hidden within,

For now weâ€™ll fight, for weâ€™re still in.|,unknown
