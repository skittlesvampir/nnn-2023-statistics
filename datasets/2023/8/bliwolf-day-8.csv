It‚Äôs day 8 and I still feel nothing as I did in the 7 days prior. Maybe the depression is my best ally for this‚Ä¶maybe my body needed a break‚Ä¶ maybe I just have no desire for any pleasure. I surely would like the good Lord or any God to give me some peace.,unknown
|This is the day I broke last year! Hope I pass it this year!
