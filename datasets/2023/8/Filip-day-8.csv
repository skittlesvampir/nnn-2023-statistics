So far it's pretty easy. Yes I feel the urge, but this extra energy beneficial for me to actually go out and talk to girls. I would say things and do things I would never do. Like dancing close to a girl and having my arm around her waist. Man that takes confident.

Even yesterday, I just invited two girls over to my party I barely knew. I met them during a social event and we exchanged Instagrams and we chit chat sometimes.

I met a girl and invited her to cook dinner with me. She would like it to be a date.

I organise parties and event. It feels good that people look at me as the planner and the party guy, but they didn't know before that I wasn't. 

Last year I failed at day 20 ish. All because I met a girl for the first time and we started to date for half a year. All because I stopped porn and actually talked to people and make friends.

Now, I hope I will have the same benefit. As of now, I can see that I am rather charming and guys and girls like to be around me. I don't know why, but I feel like not watching porn or masturbating every day gives me more confidence. 

The urgers gives me energy to try new things and somehow those new things are working out. Last year I unlocked the most fuck boy energy at day 16 ish. Even the girl I was dating thought I was really good with girls and my friend Group was all girls.

No, I am not good with girls. But NNN jut made me more confident to be around girls and it helped me a lot.|,unknown

First several days went clean, but yesterday I found myself randomly scrolling Twitter and got waylaid by some porn, which then sent me down a rabbit hole for a while. Hard habit to break, but at least I didn‚Äôt nut|,unknown
