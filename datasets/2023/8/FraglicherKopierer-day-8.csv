Still IN! Keep it up cumrades we got this!,y
|I'm still in. 
Today was easier to handle than the last few days, mostly because I kept myself busy and away from home. Had a few boners, but practically no urge today. I know I've only managed to do 25%, but that's 25% closer to 100%, you know?

To all soldiers who are still in: I don't know if anyone told you this today, but I'm damn proud of you. Keep on fighting.

To all soldiers who fell, willingly or not: worry not. We will keep fighting for you, so that you aren't forgotten. Send us strength.|,y

|Still IN! 

Last year I failed at Day 12, and I am starting to feel why. In 4 days, let's see if I can surpass myself.

Starting to workout but I hope I don't push myself so hard that I end up quitting my workouts. (Feeling tuckered out today and I need to get school work done. I'll get back to working out tomorrow)|,y
