|Still in. I tried this last year without this sub, and didn't make it very far. This year I'll try with the sub, see if it helps. Even then, I've been making small progress, so maybe I can finally break this habit.|,unknown

|It's now past midnight, count me in. Stumbled across this subreddit a while back before I made my reddit account and I want to put this challenge to rest and fight against my own impulsivity while doing so.

Best of luck to everyone participating!|,unknown
|Still in 👍🏿 


This year I'm really hoping to make some progress on what's been a nearly 2 decade long battle with addiction. I don't expect to be free at the end of these thirty days, but I've been spending so much time reading books, listening to podcasts, and doing workbooks in an effort to unearth and heal the why behind the do and now it's time to put it into action I guess. 


As they all seem to say, porn isn't the problem, it's the escape. Porn was the easy solution to genuine problems I was having, and instead of doing the hard work of finding a true solution, I settled for a counterfeit. Habits born at a young age, and hardened with time, now seem impossible to defeat, but I'm fighting once again. 

Porn has taken too much from me and I want my life back.|,unknown

|Today is November 1st, 2023. My name is Alvin Ugochukwu. I'm 25 years old and I'm from California. I participated in NNN in 2021 and I went through all of November 2021 without busting. In November 2022, I unfortunately busted to a baddie with tattoos on Instagram. It was during the middle of the month. I want to get the Diamond NoNutter role and I want to practice self-control. Anyway, thanks for reading and good luck to all of my No Nut November members!

|Still in, but most likely not for the whole month, tldr, last year had some unforeseen side effects after going cold turkey then getting back into it even worse, so I won't be participating this year, I've been practicing weaning my addiction but I'm not ready to go another month yet, still I'll be going as long as I can maintain my sanity|,unknown
