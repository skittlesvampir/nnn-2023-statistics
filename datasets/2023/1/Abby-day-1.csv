|Here we are boys, the last day. The dawn. Less than 24 hours remain. This was my first year of tying NNN even though I knew it existed back in 2021, and I'm actually surprised that I managed to win.

Yes, I really dedicated myself to this challenge, but if I won, it's also thanks to this amazing community. All the funny memes, the poems in honor of NNN and the motivational posts were really helpful. Really love y'all.
It's sad to see you go, this journey was amazing to share with all of you. If there's anywhere we can continue to share this journey, like the Don't Diddle December subreddit or others, share it, try to reach all of the cumrades, so we can keep it going.

NNN really has helped me change my mind about porn.
It generates alot of problems in the long run if you keep watching it. Obviously, watching it every once in a while doesn't make you an addict, but you could just use your immagination to make the river flow white (in fact, you should try to give it a shot on december 1st). 

Today I'll try to post on this sub about all of my journey and how amazing this community was for my NNN.

That's all from me at the moment, we got this cumrades, IT'S THE LAST LEVEL!

Still IN!|,unknown
|It's been a wild ride, everyone. Those who made it, congratulations.

|Cumrades, 115 coming on this account to report proudly that I'm still in. It's been a helluva journey and although I didn't interact much, it was nice being in the community. Logging this at 7:59 pm AWST and most likely releasing the thunder at a later date due to extended family being around.|,unknown
