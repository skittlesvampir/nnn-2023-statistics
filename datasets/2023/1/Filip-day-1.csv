|Still in.

No more fear.  No more struggle.
The war is almost over.
Stay strong for a few more hours. 
Then you'll have a year of satisfaction.|,unknown
ON MY WAY,unknown
|December is nigh. This month was easy as it went by way too fast. A blessing and a curse.

It'd been a pleasure cumrades! Still in.,unknown
|Finally. The last day. Was I waiting for it with impatience ? No. Was it because I can't take it anymore and my urges are making me feel crazy... Neither. But I'm proud of myself I made it so far.
I suffered, a lot, but now I feel strong. Not enough, but I learnt about myself and dominated my demons. But I think my journey isn't finished yet. My personal goal hasn't been reached yet I don't know when I'll reach it but I hope soon enough. For now, let's just enjoy this last day as an accomplishment. 

Soldiers, cumrades, sisters, brothers... I am proudly...

Wow, NNN is about to be over. I can't believe I made it this far. Feels good.|,unknown
|Everything will be over tomorrow

And I'll be drowning in my sorrow

Because my cumrades will be taken from me

And for a whole year lonely I will be

I made sure to enjoy it the most

But at this point at what cost?
