Still IN|,unknown
|This was so easy ngl, I didn't even bother going on Reddit because I wasn't counting the days, because I don't want to start again after November. Still in|,unknown
Still IN,unknown
Still in,unknown
|The final day, it's been a great journey and I feel I've self improved in some aspects. Looking forward to getting that quad diamond flair!|,unknown
|Man, I'll miss y'all. Turkey fucker, you too. This is my first time doing NNN and honestly, I think I'll be doing this again come next November. There were some days it was really hard, but I think deep down I knew I had it in me and I wouldn't give up, and knowing I've got the diamond waiting for me is the icing on the cake.

It's been a *pleasure,* soldiers (pun intended). Godspeed! o7
