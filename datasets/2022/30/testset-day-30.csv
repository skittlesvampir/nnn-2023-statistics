My cumrades, we have made it

We have made it to the end

And I can tell you one thing

I am proud of you my friends

For you have fought valiantly this month and come what may

You have not let anything or anyone lead you astray

My cumrades, we may only have 24 hours left with each other, but do not forget

All of the times we had in this subreddit 

Whether they be good, bad, or anything in between

These past 30 days have been an amazing 
dream

So brothers, I leave you with this. And I hope you continue to live by this whilst continuing to train your ability

For even amongst discord, my brothers, my cumrades, and my friends

We have finnaly found Tranquillity


I love all of you guys so much, this month has been so awesome and it's all thanks to each and every one of you, until next November my cumrades O7|,unknown

it was over rather quickly. Didn't expect that to be honest|,unknown
|Here we are boys, the last day. The dawn. Less than 24 hours remain. This was my first year of tying NNN even though I knew it existed back in 2021, and I'm actually surprised that I managed to win.

Yes, I really dedicated myself to this challenge, but if I won, it's also thanks to this amazing community. All the funny memes, the poems in honor of NNN and the motivational posts were really helpful. Really love y'all.
It's sad to see you go, this journey was amazing to share with all of you. If there's anywhere we can continue to share this journey, like the Don't Diddle December subreddit or others, share it, try to reach all of the cumrades, so we can keep it going.

NNN really has helped me change my mind about porn.
It generates alot of problems in the long run if you keep watching it. Obviously, watching it every once in a while doesn't make you an addict, but you could just use your immagination to make the river flow white (in fact, you should try to give it a shot on december 1st). 

Today I'll try to post on this sub about all of my journey and how amazing this community was for my NNN.

That's all from me at the moment, we got this cumrades, IT'S THE LAST LEVEL!

Got a fucking wet dream right today. So sad that this means that the big nut isnt going to be as big. Still in though.,unknown

I know many have suggested continuing NNN through December. I'd like to also suggest an alternative and plug r/digitaldetoxdecember . I likely spend too much time on electronics and I hope to reduce that number for the next month.

Edit: Nevermind, apparently that sub is now private. I don't know an alternative subreddits at this time to do a digital detox for December.|,unknown
|In case I missed it

Still in!

|At first I was afraid I was petrified
Thinking how I couldn‚Äôt live without the nut by my side
Then I spent so many nights thinking how it could go wrong
But I stayed
Told myself how to get along
And so I‚Äôm back from a dark place
I‚Äôve got all my nut to give 
I‚Äôve got all my love to give
And I‚Äôll survive|,unknown
|As I walk through the valley of the shadow of depravity

I fear no nut, for my comrades are with me

Still in, until the very end o7

It's been an honor serving for these 5 years brothers|,unknown
