|Day 30, one more day, we can do it! STILL IN!|,y
|Everything will be over tomorrow

And I'll be drowning in my sorrow

Because my cumrades will be taken from me

And for a whole year lonely I will be

I made sure to enjoy it the most

But at this point at what cost?


Still In ü´°|,y
|In my bed I wept
For the dreams I slept
Had me bust and my cum could not be kept

But then I perused
And found since my dick wasn‚Äôt used
It did not count to what I so quickly accused

So now I rejoice
For that me and the boys
Will tomorrow fap to the material of our choice|,y

|It is 10:57pm. We have done it boys, we are men now. The journey has been long and arduous but we have done it. We will sleep and wake up to a day where the restrictions on our holy excalipeens will be released. It was a Good battle and I hope to see you next year|,y
