|Pain. I know it's only 3 days left (including today), but it feels like eons. I may be 90% of the way done, but the remaining 10% is definitely going to be the hardest part to me. The week as the 20th-26th was probably the easiest I had it. Weirdly enough, though, this is the longest I've gone without nutting after learning how to do so ever. Guess that's something to be proud of, right? Still IN!|,unknown

|I went to bed a couple of hours later than I normally would, so hopefully that might help balance out with the times I went to bed early this month. I stayed up later because I was making music playlists for myself on YouTube, although I doubt I'll even use them.

I hope I can get my sleep schedule back to normal by today, but it will likely be difficult for me to not get tired early, especially since I plan on reading a lot. I look forward to each roll call now. I apparently have a lot coming up in December: my 21st birthday, Christmas, New Years, and "the big nut".

|Still In!

I'm generally surprised I survived this while. I really can't wait for it to be over as I really have a backlog of everything.|,unknown
|Still IN Alpha Mode!  Three days left!  Just a little more, everyone!  Weâ€™re almost there! o7|,unknown
