|I'm out. Honestly not even upset, I really enjoyed not jerking off, I think I'll just do this a lot more often. I'm gonna try and finish out the month.|,n

|8/30 

for some odd reason, i've taken a lot more joy in each day

|Day 8: Still in, even though I slowly started losing it. It got to the point where I felt urges towards my toilet paper roll. The hole in the middle... it just... it called to me. Luckily,  I did not do it today, however I fear tomorrow may be my breaking point.|,y

It got better after day 7, but day 8 my mind is only like oh that girl is hot oh that girl is hot
I mean in real life, there are so many hot Girls, I should probably talk to more women. But I definitely hope that the desperate looking after women will get less in the next few days.|,y

So day 8 now my comrades and I'll be honest before this I was jerking 3 -4 times a day. I'm 20 M  and I'll be honest I did it when I was bored did it when I was hard when ever I had an excuse. But now with this month. I decided to take it seriously and I'll be honest I'm truly happier now. 

Thank you for everyone's support. o7|,y
IM STILL IN BABY a few urges here and there but fighting through it,y
