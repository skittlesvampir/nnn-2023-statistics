|Still in!!!! 

Its getting tougher now and I mistakenly had a look at the hard mode subreddit last night and I have all that dirt swimming around my mind just tempting to have another look.

I need to have a smoke to take my mind off it a bit and get a pleasure hit that way but unfortunately I've also pledged to give up smoking too! 
5th week in on that 

Pray for me cumrades!|,y
