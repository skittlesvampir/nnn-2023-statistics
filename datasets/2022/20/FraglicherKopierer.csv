'Til we see the end

One final push

Good luck my friends

Still in!

Edit: I lost. Diamond would've been cool, but honestly I was afraid of the big nut on the 1st of December being just as disappointing as it was those years ago. Now I needn' t worry. Godspeed brothers, I believe in you all!|,n

|It's going ok, not great but ok. Just managed to get through an intense urge, barely anyway.

These things are getting stronger and worse with each passing day and time they happen.

The simple thought of them alone gets to me, it is getting so much worse since it starts when I wake up. Its horrid because even on the days I work which I am practically untouchable, having to wait until 4 to 3 PM PST to go to work while I wake up at 10 or 11 is a nightmare.

I'm gonna be honest, I feel like [a Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZv2OCbQOmI&ab_channel=G4FRecords), not like the big and scary one. Just one that's tired and is hanging on just barely. The urges get to me and I feel disgusting, sure I'm able to stop them, but they drag me further from my goal each time. I feel fine now, thankfully.

But I worry that one day, I'll be dragged far enough and I will never come back.
