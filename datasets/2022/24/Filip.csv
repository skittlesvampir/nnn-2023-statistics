|Day 24

First of all, to all my cumrades reading. Happy thanksgiving! Rn, I've been having plenty of body aches and soreness because of my workout sessions. With all the gym posts I've been seeing. I just can't accept that my muscle growth is slow. As of rn, I've been breaking my limits. 

I could only do 100 push ups consecutively, so each day, I would try to break it, atleast reach 101 push ups is already enough. Same goes to squats, curls, etc. I'm not finishing this month without any visible improvements to myself.
