|Still in, was meant to post yesterday, but forgot, I hope this doesn't make me lose my eligibility for the Diamond flair, been doing this since 2019, just that this month has been busy, which I guess is a good thing for me, but it also means I have not putting attention in the roll calls. Please accept this roll call for the 23rd and I'll make another roll call later today so that I'm on track to get this year's Diamond flair.|,unknown
