|In the spirit of trying new things, I'll try a rhyme too.


So many keep falling

For porn never stops calling

They claim they're in control, no addiction to address

As if it's not a crutch they use to deal with stress

Lies all lies, for they couldn't keep a simple pledge 

Fools who thought "I can still win if I just edge" 

And now they sit in the company of regret 

Hoping soon to just forget|,y

|I was caught, in the middle of a railroad track

I looked 'round, and I knew there was no turning back

My mind raced, and I thought, what could I do?

And I knew there was no help, no help from you

Sound of the drums, beating in my heart

The thunder of guns, tore me apart

You've been
Thunderstruck!
