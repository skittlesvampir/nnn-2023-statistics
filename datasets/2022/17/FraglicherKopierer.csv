|I'm OUT. Unfortunately, this challenge was affecting my sleep too much. Gainz and reducing stress are more important to me than completing this challenge, unfortunately. It's been fun guys. Good luck.|,n

|I just joined, this is my first NNN
I'm confused and shocked that it has a subreddit (this is the first i searched for it to know more about it and just found it a minute ago)

My day 1 going strong i had many things to do for Halloween and stuff and it lasted for about a week.
 
2nd week was a disaster the urges kicking.
I started asking, "why I'm doing this." "Am i the only one doing this?", "Should i just give in" and my mind was like just surrender to the urges and stuff.

Been fighting since now November 17 2022 when i was liked what if i sleep and suddenly had a wet dreams does it counts and i started searching for rules and regulations for No nut November.

And luckily found it, [The rules and regulations ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonutnovember/comments/9ted30/rules_for_participating_in_no_nut_november/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)|,y

|O7 I'm out. 

Touching grass definitely helps but having so much hw and my procrastination keeps me indoors.

At least I got silver! Will still go the rest of the month without Nutting. If I can go over half, what's another half?|,n

|I think I had a wet dream, or maybe it was precum (small aftermath and yellow colored). I have had multiple dreams this month in which it felt like I nutted. I don't know if that was my mind pranking me or if my drive has actually been higher than in any previous NNN. It seems as if anticipation of the big nut and thinking about it too much might have made my subconscious speed up the cycle.

I was able to go the entire November of 2020 without a wet dream so that I could enjoy "the big nut" for the first time. Last year, I had a wet dream within a few hours of December 1st (I was pissed off). This year it seems impossible for me to enjoy "the big nut" again. The dream I had was very disturbing and unpleasant in retrospect (something that would likely make most of the people on here a lot less horny). My subconscious has turned to extreme measures before in order to try to get me to do things (although it usually happened while I was depressed).
