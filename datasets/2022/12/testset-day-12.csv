|This is the day

I will say ‚ÄúFUCK 12‚Äù

Because I‚Äôll get to Day 30

And horniness shall remain on the shelf

Urges are worse than ever

And yet I continue upon this endeavor

For the third time, for the grandeur

To win No Nut November

|Another day has passed

I'm holding my rifle

Against the far horizons

Many has lost this week

But we shall stay strong

My gaze is only at the front

The diamond flair

The achievement

The self proud

I will stay strong

I will move

STILL IN
